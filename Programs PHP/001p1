Pattern Problem - 2 (100 Marks)
You need to take an integer input and then draw the pattern according to it. Say for example if you enter 5 then, the pattern should be like this-
1 1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3 3
4 4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5

Input Format
You will take an integer input n from stdin.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 1000

Output Format
Your output should be the pattern according to the input which you had entered. 


<?php
  /* Read input from STDIN. Print your output to STDOUT*/
    $__fp = fopen("php://stdin", "r");
  //Write code here
function drawPattern($n) {
    for ($i = 1; $i <= $n; $i++) {
        for ($j = 1; $j <= 5; $j++) {
          if($j<5)
            echo $i." ";
          else 
            echo $i;
        }
        echo "\n";
    }
}

// Take input from the user
$num = readline("Enter an integer: ");

// Call the function to draw the pattern
drawPattern($num);
?>
