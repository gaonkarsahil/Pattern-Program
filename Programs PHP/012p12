You need to take an integer input and then draw the pattern according to it. Say for example if you enter 5 then, the pattern should be like this-
A
A B
A B C
A B C D
A B C D E 

Input Format
You will take an integer input n from stdin.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 26

Output Format
Your output should be the pattern according to the input which you had entered. 

<?php
  /* Read input from STDIN. Print your output to STDOUT*/
  $fp = fopen("php://stdin", "r");
  //Write code here

  function drawPattern($n) {
    for($i=1;$i<=$n;$i++) {
      for($j=1;$j<=$i;$j++) {
        echo $i===$j ? chr(64+$j) : chr(64+$j)." ";
      }
      echo "\n";
    }
  }
  $n = readline('');
  drawPattern($n);
?>
